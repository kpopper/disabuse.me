Half-baked idea for dealing with twitter abuse. Pre-dates Twitter's Report Abuse. Can't remember what it was supposed to do with the people you wanted to "report" but it probably isn't a great idea to have a database full of the usernames of abusive idiots.

Also this thing itself would be totally open to abuse. Ironically.
